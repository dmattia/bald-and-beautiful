			<span>In 2009, a small group of dedicated ND students held our first The Bald & the Beautiful (TBAB) event. That year, 140 students shaved their head and raised $26,500. Since then, TBAB's presence in the ND community has grown exponentially. TBAB now has over 40 student volunteers, 1500 participants, and has raised more than $195,000 benefiting the St. Baldrick's Foundation and Memorial Hospital, and given over 400 hair donations to Pantene Beautiful Lengths. Help us achieve our goal in raising $300,000 in just six years to help these beautiful children and their families!</span>
			<span>Although TBAB is now a student club on campus with events throughout the year, our main event is in April in the days preceding the annual Blue and Gold football game. Students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community members get involved through shaving their heads, donating 8-inches of their hair, and purchasing colored hair extensions.</span>

	<div id="faq" class="animated contentRow">

		<div id="faqContent">
	
			<div class="question">What happens during the event?</div>
			<div class="answer">TBAB is a 3-day event, held annually in the Sorin and Dooley rooms of the LaFortune Student Center. Over the course of these days, supporters shave their heads in solidarity with cancer patients, donate 8-inches of hair to be donated to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program, and/or receive multi-colored hair extensions in support of those inflicted with various forms of cancer.</div>

			<div class="question">Do I need to Pre-Register for the event?</div>
			<div class="answer">While we encourage participants to Pre-Register for head shavings and hair donations in the days and weeks leading up to the event, walk-ups are always welcome. TBAB members are always on hand to get you registered and accept donations throughout the event. There is no pre-registration for hair extensions.</div>

			<div class="question">Where do the donations go?</div>
			<div class="answer">Donations given to TBAB are split between the St. Baldrick’s Foundation and Memorial Hospital in South Bend. St. Baldrick’s is a national organization that helps fund pediatric cancer research, in addition to supporting the children inflicted and their families. Donations sent to Memorial Hospital are reserved for use in their Pediatric Cancer wing, and will ultimately be used for the improvement of these facilities.</div>

			<div class="question">Can I monitor how much has been donated in my name?</div>
			<div class="answer">Yes! If you would like to know donations made to your name, email cmcnamee@nd.edu.</div>

			<div class="question">How can I get involved?</div>
			<div class="answer">For Students, it’s as easy as joining our club! We host meetings every Sunday at 5PM in the Notre Dame of LaFortune. You can also get involved by volunteering at the event. If you’re part of a dorm, team or club, work with us to get your whole group involved and become an official partner!</div>
			<div class="answer">For Alumni, you can help us reach out to your fellow alumni around the country to let them know what TBAB is doing to find a cure. You can also host a TBAB event in your own city!</div>
			<div class="answer">For Stylists, you can give an hour or a few hours of your time at our three-day event helping to shave heads, cut hair for wig donations, or apply hair extensions. Please contact us at gcarrol2@nd.edu to sign-up for a time.</div>
			<div class="answer">For all other supporters, you can either visit our donation page to become a sponsor, or email us at tbab@nd.edu and we can work together to get you involved.</div>

			<div class="question">What is the minimum fundraising required to shave my head?</div>
			<div class="answer">The minimum donation required is $10, or $20 if you would like a TBAB t-shirt. Additional fundraising is highly encouraged!</div>

			<div class="question">How long must my hair be for donation?</div>
			<div class="answer">Hair donations must be at least 8-inches in length.</div>

			<div class="question">Are my donations Tax Deductible?</div>
			<div class="answer">Yes, donations to Notre Dame Social Service clubs are eligible tax deductions. If you need supporting documentation, please contact us at tbab@nd.edu.</div>

			Over the first years of The Bald & The Beautiful event participation among residence halls has varied greatly. 
			This year, we challenge more dorms to get involved. The hall that gets the most guys to shave their head will receive funds to get food for the dorm. 
			If you would like to schedule a time slot for your dorm to shave together, email Cullen at cmcnamee@nd.edu. 
			Track your dorm standings (beginning March 1st) by visiting the <a href="#mens" onclick="showContent('#mens')">Men's Rankings</a> page.

			Ladies who pre-register to donate eight or more inches of hair through Pantene Beautiful Lengths will be entered into
