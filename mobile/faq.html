          <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
          <p><b>What happens during the event?</b></p>
          <p class="indent"> TBAB is a 3-day event, held annually in the Sorin and Dooley rooms of the LaFortune Student Center. Over the course of these days, supporters shave their heads in solidarity with cancer patients, donate 8-inches of hair to be donated to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program, and/or receive multi-colored hair extensions in support of those inflicted with various forms of cancer.           </p>


          <p><b>Do I need to Pre-Register for the event?</b></p>
          <p class="indent"> While we encourage participants to Pre-Register for head shavings and hair donations in the days and weeks leading up to the event, walk-ups are always welcome. TBAB members are always on hand to get you registered and accept donations throughout the event. There is no pre-registration for hair extensions.           </p>

          <p><b>Where do the donations go?</b></p>
          <p class="indent"> Donations given to TBAB are split between the St. Baldrick’s Foundation and Memorial Hospital in South Bend. St. Baldrick’s is a national organization that helps fund pediatric cancer research, in addition to supporting the children inflicted and their families. Donations sent to Memorial Hospital are reserved for use in their Pediatric Cancer wing, and will ultimately be used for the improvement of these facilities.           </p>

          <p><b>Can I monitor how much has been donated in my name?</b></p>
          <p class="indent"> Yes! If you would like to know donations made to your name, email cmcnamee@nd.edu.</p>

          <p><b>How can I get involved?</b></p>
          <p class="padding"> <b>For Students</b>, it’s as easy as joining our club! We host meetings every Sunday at 5PM in the Notre Dame of LaFortune. You can also get involved by volunteering at the event. If you’re part of a dorm, team or club, work with us to get your whole group involved and become an official partner! 
</br></br><b>For Alumni</b>, you can help us reach out to your fellow alumni around the country to let them know what TBAB is doing to find a cure. You can also host a TBAB event in your own city!
</br></br><b>For Stylists</b>, you can give an hour or a few hours of your time at our three-day event helping to shave heads, cut hair for wig donations, or apply hair extensions. Please contact us at gcarrol2@nd.edu to sign-up for a time.
</br></br><b>For all other supporters</b>, you can either visit our donation page to become a sponsor, or email us at tbab@nd.edu and we can work together to get you involved. 
</p>

          <p><b>What is the minimum fundraising required to shave my head?</b></p>
          <p class="indent">The minimum donation required is $10, or $20 if you would like a TBAB t-shirt.  Additional fundraising is highly encouraged! 
</p>


          <p><b>How long must my hair be for donation?</b></p>
          <p class="indent">Hair donations must be at least 8-inches in length.
</p>

          <p><b>Are my donations Tax Deductible?</b></p>
          <p class="indent">Yes, donations to Notre Dame Social Service clubs are eligible tax deductions. If you need supporting documentation, please contact us at tbab@nd.edu.
